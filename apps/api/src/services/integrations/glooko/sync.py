"""Autonomous Glooko (Omnipod Cloud Sync) sync orchestrator.

Ties the pieces together for one user, one cycle:

    decrypt email/password               [core.encryption]
        -> web Devise login -> session   [auth.glooko_login]
        -> keyset-cursor pump streams +  [client.GlookoClient.fetch_stream]
           date-windowed CGM points      [client.GlookoClient.fetch_cgm_points]
        -> map -> MappedRecords          [mapper.map_glooko]
        -> upsert glucose + pump events  [storage.store_glooko_records]

and updates the user's ``GlookoSyncState`` (freshness, status, error, cumulative
counter, advanced per-stream cursor, CGM high-water mark) -- committing the mapped
records and the state row in a SINGLE final commit so a crash can't leave data
stored with the status not yet flipped to connected.

Two entry points share the per-user lock and the decrypt/login/error machinery:

  * ``sync_glooko_for_user`` -- the incremental tick (scheduler + manual "Sync
    now"). Resumes each pump stream from its stored keyset cursor and the CGM
    path from ``last_cgm_window_end``; advances both and bumps ``last_sync_at``.
  * ``import_glooko_history_for_user`` -- the one-time historical backfill
    (the import endpoint). Paginates each pump stream from the epoch
    under a page budget and walks the CGM path back over a bounded window. It does
    NOT touch the incremental cursors or ``last_sync_at`` -- it fills the past, it
    doesn't make the connection fresher (Tandem #669 import-doesn't-bump lesson).

The Glooko session cookie is ephemeral (re-minted on 401 via the reauth callback),
so unlike the Medtronic refresh token there is nothing rotating to lose mid-cycle;
the single final commit is about glucose/state atomicity, not credential safety.
